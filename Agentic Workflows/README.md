# Agentic Workflows

_"I think AI agent workflows will drive massive AI progress this year â€” perhaps even more than the next generation of foundation models. This is an important trend, and I urge everyone who works in AI to pay attention to it."_
- Andrew Ng

## Introduction: 

LLMs are mostly used in zero-shot mode, prompting a model to generate an output directly. With an agent workflow, we can ask the LLM to go through some steps and iteration to get the final output. Such an iterative workflow yields much better results than a single pass.
