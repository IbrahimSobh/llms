# Agentic Workflows

_"I think AI agent workflows will drive massive AI progress this year â€” perhaps even more than the next generation of foundation models. This is an important trend, and I urge everyone who works in AI to pay attention to it."_ Andrew Ng

## Introduction: 

LLMs are mostly used in zero-shot mode, prompting a model to generate an output directly. With an agent workflow, we can ask the LLM to go through some steps and iteration to get the final output. Such an iterative workflow yields much better results than a single pass. 

ðŸ¤–[LangGraph](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph) is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, built on top of (and intended to be used with) LangChain.

This code is the first step of using LangGraph to bulid generic and simple graphs even without LLMs.


## LangGrpah, minimal code

This is a simple code for using LangGrpah (even without any AI / LLMs). The graph is defined by:
- Nodes or functions
- Edges to connect the nodes

To keep the sate along the graph, a dictionary is usually used beween the calls. Here is a simple code how we define the nodes, edges and construct the graph. 

```
# Define the nodes
workflow.add_node("generate_number", generate_number)  # generation a number
workflow.add_node("check_number", check_number)  # check number

# Build graph
workflow.set_entry_point("generate_number")
workflow.add_edge("generate_number", "check_number")
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "check_number",
    decide_to_finish,
    {
        "end": END,
        "generate": "generate_number",
    },
)

# Compile
app = workflow.compile()

```

Let's see the code for using LangGraph in different simple situations:

- Guess the number, if fail, try again
- Try to guess a number or char, if you fail try again.
- Try to guess a number, if succeed, try to guess a char, if fail in number or chat, try again.
