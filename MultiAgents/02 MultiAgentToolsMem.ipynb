        "This notebook demonstrates how to build a multi-agent research team using CrewAI. The agents can use tools like web search and memory to collaborate on tasks of Proposing novel LLM research contributions, Evaluating the novelty and impact of proposed contributions and Writing research titles and abstracts. The goal of this system is to streamline the research process by leveraging AI agents for idea generation, evaluation, and writing.\n",

M-LLMs could provide interpretation of an image, the sentiment of a sound clip, and the context of a video and analyze the structure and content of a full document, in addition to editing text and simulating discussions. In this paper, we focus on health care, medical, and research-related use cases. The CANGARU guidelines are an example of how important steps are being made toward establishing an international consensus in the appropriate use of LLMs across research disciplines. In this study, we conduct a systematic study of the potential and possible limitations of zero-shot prompt-based LLMs on medical evidence summarization using GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT models. We then ...

            "Final Answer: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has propelled them to the forefront of applications in natural language processing (NLP). This paper aims to present a comprehensive examination of the research landscape in LLMs, providing an overview of the prevailing themes and topics within this dynamic domain. We conduct a systematic analysis of over 2,000 LLM-related research papers published in top NLP conferences and journals, identifying key research directions and emerging trends. Our findings reveal that LLMs are being extensively explored for various tasks, including text generation, translation, question answering, and dialogue systems. We also highlight promising avenues for future research, such as the development of more efficient and interpretable LLMs, as well as the exploration of their applications in real-world scenarios.\u001b[0m\n",

Importance Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT are powerful generative systems that rapidly synthesize natural language responses. Research on LLMs has revealed their potential and pitfalls, especially in clinical settings. However, the evolving landscape of LLM research in medicine has left several gaps regarding their evaluation, application, and evidence base. Objective ... Information Retrieval (IR): LLMs are used both as models for retrieving information and to enhance existing IR models, improving the accuracy and relevance of search results. Key Takeaways Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for supporting, augmenting, and even automating psychotherapy through tasks ranging from note-taking during interviews to assessment and delivering therapy. However, psychotherapy is a uniquely complex, high-stakes domain. The use of LLMs in this field poses wide-ranging safety, legal, and ethical concerns. We propose a framework for ...\n",
