Our approach addresses this challenge by leveraging contextual information to guide the reasoning process, enabling LLMs to make more informed and accurate inferences. We evaluate our approach on a range of reasoning tasks and demonstrate significant improvements in performance compared to existing LLM-based methods. Our findings suggest that incorporating contextualized information is a promising direction for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs, opening up new possibilities for their application in complex reasoning tasks.\u001b[0m\n",
