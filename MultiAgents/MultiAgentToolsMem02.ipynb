        "This notebook demonstrates how to build a multi-agent research team using CrewAI. The agents can use tools like web search and memory to collaborate on tasks of Proposing novel LLM research contributions, Evaluating the novelty and impact of proposed contributions and Writing research titles and abstracts. The goal of this system is to streamline the research process by leveraging AI agents for idea generation, evaluation, and writing.\n",
