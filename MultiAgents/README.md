# AI Multi-Agent Systems 

## Introduction:
The power of Multi-agent AI has more to offer. Frameworks for building multi-agent systems are designed to enable AI agents to have roles, share goals, and operate in a cohesive unit. Whether you're building an automated customer service, or research team, multi-agents systmes provide the main building blocks for sophisticated multi-agent interactions.

For example, [crewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) is an open-source framework for building multi-agent systems that can automate complex, multi-step tasks. Here are the main features of crewAI:
- Role-playing: Assign specialized roles to agents 
- Memory: Provide agents with short-term, long-term, and shared memory
- Tools: Assign pre-built and custom tools to each agent (e.g. for web search)
- Guardrails: Effectively handle errors, hallucinations, and infinite loops
- Cooperation: Perform tasks in series, in parallel, and hierarchically.
- LLMs: GPT, Gemini, Llama, etc.
