# AI Multi-Agent Systems 

## Introduction:
The power of Multi-agent AI has more to offer. Frameworks for building multi-agent systems are designed to enable AI agents to have roles, share goals, and operate in a cohesive unit. Whether you're building an automated customer service, or research team, multi-agents systmes provide the main building blocks for sophisticated multi-agent interactions.

For example, [crewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) is an open-source framework for building multi-agent systems that can automate complex, multi-step tasks. Here are the main features of crewAI:
- Role-playing: Assign specialized roles to agents 
- Memory: Provide agents with short-term, long-term, and shared memory
- Tools: Assign pre-built and custom tools to each agent (e.g. for web search)
- Guardrails: Effectively handle errors, hallucinations, and infinite loops
- Cooperation: Perform tasks in series, in parallel, and hierarchically.
- LLMs: GPT, Gemini, Llama, etc.

### 3) Multi agent research team with an LLM Manager
This code implements a hierarchical multi-agent system designed to simulate a research team with a manager. The system aims to automate the process of generating research contributions in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs).
The manager's role is to oversee the entire research process, including:Task Allocation: Assigning tasks to agents (Researcher, Supervisor, Writer) based on their capabilities, Coordination, and validation. This hierarchical structure mimics a real-world research team, enhancing organization and efficiency in generating novel LLM research contributions. By specifying a manager it oversees task execution, including planning, delegation, and validation. The manager allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities, reviews outputs, and assesses task completion.

**Title: Enhancing Large Language Models for Improved Accuracy and Contextual Relevance**

**Abstract**: 

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, they still face challenges with accuracy and contextual relevance. This paper proposes several enhancements to address these limitations. Firstly, we increase the number of beams used in the decoder to improve the accuracy of the output sequence. Secondly, we customize the LLM for domain-specific data to provide more relevant and contextually appropriate responses. Thirdly, we incorporate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to address hallucinations and out-of-date training data. Finally, we specify the writing style, tone, audience, and response to guide the LLM's output. Experimental results demonstrate that these enhancements significantly improve the accuracy and contextual relevance of the LLM's responses.
